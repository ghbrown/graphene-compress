Geometry data used to validate and test during development, as well as run examples.

Data files were selected from [my collaborator's more complete data set](https://github.com/qmc-hamm/graphene_optimized_geometry) and represent optimized geometries of twisted bilayer graphene using density functional theory and molecular dynamics.
